    calculateTax(5000); //When have value it means "Passing a value into the function"
    //remember to always call out the name of the function for it to run.

    //We can have multiple parameters in a function. Just seperate them with comma







    //return;  will return undeifned. However, this will not return anything because we already have a return above. Only the first return will be run

    // Variables that can be accessed anywhere is called Global Variables

    // Parameters - a feature and opposite of function.Works the same way as variable. Allows us to put value(s) into the function through parameter.
