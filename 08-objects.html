<!--
-console.log() and Math.random() are actually called as Method (Object + Function)

-JSON is a built-in objects that has more universal syntax rather than Javascript. We use JSON when we share data between 2 computers that might use different language. 

-LocalStorage - another built-in object

-JSON(Javascript Object Notation)

-JSON Object helps us convert Javascript Object into JSON
