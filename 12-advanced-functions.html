    /*
     IMPORTANT NOTES:
      Functions are values.
        That means:
        You can store them in variables
        You can pass them as arguments
        You can call them later

     -Advantage of using function is called Hoisting, so we don't need to worry what order is our code
 
     -Hoisting doesn't work when we save function in a variable
 
     - what else can we do with a value? We can save it in an Object.

     Rule of thumb (memorize this)
      If the function answers “what happens here?” → anonymous
      If the function answers “what is this?” → named
